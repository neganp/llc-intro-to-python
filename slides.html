        Imagine you&rsquo;re organizing **National Learn to Code Day 2016**.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/learn-to-code-day.jpg)
        You want it to be an *even bigger success* than last year, so not only do you need to know how many people attended (so you can beat that target), but you also want to pull other interesting stats to put in a press release.

        Today, you&rsquo;ll learn to 'think' like a computer as you gather insights into who attended Ladies Learning Code workshops in 2015.

        ## What is programming?

        * Programming is **giving instructions to your computer** in a form that it can understand
        * Computers need very **specific** instructions
        * In a very particular format (i.e. a programming language)

        <pre>
#include<stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  printf("Hello, world!");

        The console is an interactive tool used to test and debug code and is included in PyCharm! Let&rsquo;s open the console:

        ![Tools &gt; Python Console&hellip;](./framework/img/workshop/open-console1.png)

        The console will pop up at the bottom of the application. Type code (instructions) after the green `>>>` symbol. This symbol is used to represent a space to enter your input but you don&rsquo;t have to actually type it.

        ![Python Console in PyCharm](./framework/img/workshop/open-console2.png)

        **Pro tip!** You can also open and close the console by selecting the icon in the lower left of PyCharm.

        ## Aside: Python can remember **code**

        A *function* is some code stored in a variable so it can be re-used

        Functions are **defined** with `def`

        Once a function is defined it can be *called* from other code

        A function has *arguments* &mdash; values that are set when the function is **called** instead of when it is **defined**

        A function can **return** a value to code that called it (with `return`)

        ```python
        >>> def greet(name):
        ...     return "Hello, " + name + "!"
        ...
        >>> msg = greet("World")
        >>> print(msg)
        Hello, variable!

        ## Functions

        We won't be writing many functions today. They can be hard to get the hang of <span style="font-size: 200%">&#x1f615;</span>

        We *will* be using built-in functions and [Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) functions

        ## Useful function: `raw_input`

        The "opposite" of `print`: reads a value from the console and pulls it into your program

        ```python
        >>> x = raw_input("Enter a value: ")
        Enter a value: 3
        >>> x
        '3'
        ```

        The string you give it as an argument is the *prompt* that will be displayed

        Try it in your console. It will look something like this:

        Your program should:

        1. Ask a user at the console to type their name
        2. Print out a message like `"Hello, (person's name)!"

        Save it in a new file and run it with PyCharm

        ### Hints

        - Strings `"look like this"`, are combined with `+` and printed with `print()`
        - `raw_input()` accepts a prompt as input and returns input from the console

        Write a program that decides what you should wear based on the
        weather. Your program should:

        - Ask the user about the weather (e.g. is it `cold` or `hot` or `raining`)
        - Read their response from the console
        - Print some advice based on their response
        - Handle `cold`, `hot`, and `rainy` weather (and more kinds if you want!)

        Here's an outline to get you started:

        ```
        input = raw_input("What's the weather like?")

        else:
            print("I don't know what " + input + " is.")

        ## Transforming data

        With `int`, `float`, and `str`, you can put numbers in strings

        ```python
        >>> t = 11
        >>> "The time is " + t
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
        >>> "The time is " + str(11)
        'The time is 11'
        ```

        Or get numbers out of strings
        ```python
        >>> egg_cost = 0.25
        >>> eggs = '12'
        >>> egg_cost * egg
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        NameError: name 'egg' is not defined
        >>> egg_cost * int(egg)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        NameError: name 'egg' is not defined
        >>> egg_cost * int(eggs)

        ## Exercise: Smarter Weather (15mins)

        Instead of telling your program if it's cold, you can input the temperature and let it decide what to do.

        * open the existing **ex3_smarter_weather.py** file
        * use math comparison operators, `and`/`or` to complete the exercise
        * follow the instructions in the comments
        * feel free to choose your own temperatures and messages :)

        ```
        # if the weather is greater than or equal to 25 degrees
        if "replace this with the right condition":
            print("Go to the beach!")
        # the weather is less than 25 degrees AND greater than 15 degrees
        elif "replace this with the right conditions":
            # Still warm enough for ice cream!
        else:
            # Wear a sweater and dream of beaches.
        ```

        Note: The hash-symbols (`#`) mark **comments**; Python ignores everything that comes after them.

        ## Opening a file

        Computer data is often stored in files such **.csv** (comma-separated values) files.
        These file types are used to represent spreadsheet-like data.

        Let's look at the example below to see how to open these files in Python and print the contents to the screen.

        Back in the console, try adding the below commands.

        When you open a file using the "with" syntax, that creates a new block and the file will be closed automatically for you as soon as you exit the block. In the terminal, you press enter twice after the last line in the block to exit the block

        ```python
        >>> with open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv') as chapters:
        >>>     print(chapters.read())
        >>>
        # ... lots of file data ...
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files

        To make use of the data in a file, we need to make sense of small portions at a time.
        In the `llc-chapters.csv` file, each line of the file represents a Ladies Learning Code chapter.

        Let&rsquo;s try printing out a few individual lines using the example below. Remember, only add the code after the `>>>` symbol.

        ```python
        >>> with open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv') as chapters:
        >>>     print(chapters.readline())
        City,Province,Chapter Lead(s)

        >>>     print(chapters.readline())
        Vancouver,BC,Meghan

        >>>     print(chapters.readline())
        Calgary,AB,Darcie
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## One line at a time

        In the previous slide we printed out three lines in the file, one at a time.
        Notice that all three lines have exactly three values, separated by a comma.

        ```
        City,Province,Chapter Lead(s)
        Vancouver,BC,Meghan
        Calgary,AB,Darcie
        ```

        * the first line shows the headings that describe the data in the next lines
        * the second and third line each represent one of the LLC chapter cities & the name of the chapter lead

        That's because it's pulling the data from the rows & columns of the CSV file.

        ## Loops: Reading all the lines in a file

        We've just seen how to print out one line of a time but what if you need to read all the lines in the file?

        In programming, to perform the same action many times in a row, **loops** are used.
        In Python, try using the `for` loop to print each of the rows in the file.

        Here's some sample code:

        ```python
        >>> with open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv') as chapters:
        >>>     for line in chapters:
        ...         print(line)
        ...
        ```

        **Pro tip!** After adding `print(line)` & enter, press enter again to execute the loop.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## `for` loop behind the scenes

        Behind the scenes, the for loop is doing something roughly like:

        ```python
        line = next(chapters)
        # Execute your code block
        # ...
        # Go back to get the next value and repeat until there are no more values
        ```

        We&rsquo;ll use the `for` loop in our future exercises to work with a larger file.

        ## Libraries

        Python has many useful built in **libraries** &mdash; collections of pre-written code.

        Today we&rsquo;ll use the **csv** library to help us make more sense of the data contained in a CSV file and learn more about the LLC activities in 2015.

        More info: https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html

        ## Using a library

        So far, we've been writing all our code in the console or in one file. When you use a library, you don't want to copy all that code into your file, otherwise it would become huge!

        Instead, **import** the functions and other structures from a **module** to use the code without actually adding all of the code into your file.

        In your console, import the `csv` library as follows:

        ```python
        >>> import csv
        ```

        Then type `csv.` and wait. It will show a list of everything in that module.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Reading data from a CSV file

        The CSV library has a number of different tools for extracting data from a CSV file. Instead of a line of comma-separated values like in the previous example, we can access individual values (like the cells of a spreadsheet).

        Today we&rsquo;ll mostly use the `DictReader` tool to access the values.

        1. import the `csv` library
        1. open the file
        1. pass the file into `DictReader`

        ```
        >>> import csv
        >>> with open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv') as chapters_file:
        >>>     chapters_data = csv.DictReader(chapters_file)
        ```

        Now, we can pull out one row at a time.

        ```
        >>>     chapter = next(chapters_data)
        >>>     print(chapter)
        {'City': 'Vancouver', 'Chapter Lead(s)': 'Meghan', 'Province': 'BC'}
        >>>     type(chapter)
        <type 'dict'>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Dictionaries

        Using `DictReader` to print the values from the CSV file, outputs a `dict`ionary representing each row in the file, in *key: value pairs*, instead of comma-separated values.

        Columns representing each city, can now be accessed with a keyword and the same for chapter leads and province.

        ```python
        >>> chapter = {'City': 'Vancouver', 'Chapter Lead(s)': 'Meghan', 'Province': 'BC'}
        >>> print(chapter['City'])
        Vancouver
        >>> print(chapter['Province'])

        ## Working in a `for` loop

        Earlier, we learned how `for` loops can repeat the same set of instructions. Let's take a look at this example below.

        * the `for` loop assigns *each row* to the `chapter` variable
        * group instructions together with the same indentation
        * all the instructions in the indented block are run for each `chapter`
        * remember to press enter again after the last instruction in the for loop to execute it

        ```python
        >>> import csv
        >>> with open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv') as chapters_file:
        >>>     chapters = csv.DictReader(chapters_file)
        >>>     for chapter in chapters:
        ...         print(chapter['City'] + ', ' + chapter['Province'])
        ...         print('    ' + chapter['Chapter Lead(s)'])
        ...
        Vancouver, BC
            Meghan
        Calgary, AB
            Darcie

        ## Counting loops

        Sometimes you want to keep track of the number of times something happened.

        We can add `1` to the current value of a variable, and assign it back to the same variable. Python processes everything to the right of the `=` before assigning the result.

        ```python
        >>> count = 0
        >>> count = count + 1
        >>> print(count)
        1
        ```

        Count the number of chapters in **llc-chapters.csv** by adding one each time it loops.

        ```python
        # file: exercises/demo_loop_count.py
        import csv

        with open('llc-chapters.csv') as csv_file:
            csv_data = csv.DictReader(csv_file)
            count = 0
            for row in csv_data: 
                count += 1 
 
            print("There are " + str(count) + " chapters")

        ## Finding a word in a string

        So far, we've compared entire strings to each other `"Python" == "Python"`. The `.find()` method can be used with strings to search its contents.

        It takes one argument, a substring to search for, and returns the position where the substring begins, **starting with 0**.

        ```python
        >>> "Ladies Learning Code".find("Code")
        16
        >>> title = "National Learn to Code Day"
        >>> title.find("Code")
        18
        >>> title.find("code")
        -1
        ```

        The `.find()` function is case-sensitive â€“Â it will only match the *exact* string you pass to  it.

        ## Exercise 5: Find chapters with co-leads (15 mins)

        In the **llc-chapters.csv** file, the `&` character is used to separate the co-lead names.

        You can use `.find()` to look for a string within a string, to figure out which cities have co-leads.

        Remember, `.find()` returns the index of the search string in the other string **or** `-1` to signal nothing was found. Try using the `>=` operator to determine if the string was found.

        ```python
        >>> leads = "Nancy & Cassie"
        >>> if leads.find("&") >= 0:
        ...     print(leads + " are co-leads")
        ...
        Nancy & Cassie are co-leads
        ```

        Create a new file, **ex5_coleaders.py**, and use what you've learned so far to find which chapter cities have co-leads.

        * Print a list of cities with co-leads
        * Count how many chapters have co-leads

        ## Bonus Exercise: Open Data Hackathon

        If you want to use different data, there are lots available for public use. The Government of Canada has many data sets available. Here are a few [suggested data sets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14fFZPKrb0RrKpjiAQYshwT3iYkTRGKeeFcpz3r8m8Qg)
        including registered charities, population estimates, consumer price data, and more.

        **Pro tip!** Open the data in program like Excel or [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/) to see the data.

        * Can you identify any interesting patterns?
        * What are you interested in learning from the data?
        * What do you want the output to be?

        So far we've seen examples where the output goes to the screen, but you might simply want to filter out a smaller
        set of results and write them back to a new CSV (see `reference/writing_csv.py` for an example).

        Take the consumer vehicle [Fuel Consumption Ratings](http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64).

        ### Writing results to a CSV file

        * Just like `DictReader` there's a `DictWriter` in the csv package
        * Gather data then write out the headers and data to a file
        * Useful for filtering a big set of data down to something you can analyse in a spreadsheet program
        * See `reference/writing_csv.py`

        ### Reading files in other languages (like French)

        * Python 2.x defaults to ASCII (very basic letters and numbers)
        * Most text on the internet with accents or foreign characters (Arabic, Chinese, etc.) are represented in [Unicode](http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding.en)
        * You can install the [unicodecsv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicodecsv/0.13.0) package with [pip](http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/) and it will read and write CSV files containing accents and other characters
